This readme describes the concept of collapsibles, also known as accordion elements, used within the project.

## What are Collapsibles?

Collapsibles are interactive elements that allow users to expand and collapse sections of content. They are particularly useful for organizing large amounts of information or content that might not be immediately relevant to all users. In their collapsed state, they hide the content, saving space and decluttering the user interface. Clicking on a collapsible element (usually a heading or title) expands it, revealing the detailed information underneath.

## Benefits of Collapsibles:

Improved User Experience: By hiding less important details, collapsibles provide a cleaner and more focused interface for users.
Information Organization: They help structure complex information by grouping related content together.
Scannability: Users can quickly scan through headings to find the information they need without being overwhelmed by excessive content.
